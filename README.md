# Ball Pitch Detection 🎾

## Problem Statement 🎯

This project aims to detect the quadrant at which a ball is pitched and determine the exact timeframe when it happens in a video showing throws at different speeds and quadrants.

## Solution Overview 💡

We used OpenCV for quadrant mapping and trajectory tracking. The key to our success is a unique pitch detection logic: identifying the point with the lowest angle between its previous and next movement points.
